 A web app developed with a partner that would allow a user to create and maintain a personal catalogue of various media types while also providing the user with access to personal metrics and to have a social outlet for potential recommendations in a modern, responsive environment. Began as a class project, but development is planned to continue as a personal project for my partner and myself.

This game is a remodelling of the old flash Defend Your Tower game designed for mobile android use. You play from the perspective of your castle, and you flick StuckDude enemies away from your castle until they take enough damage to die. There are various types of StickDudes and power-ups to add a bit of variance to gameplay. This is developed using Java and the LibGDX libraries.</p>

This project developed a two person chat that used only images for communication. Only the most recent image sent is shown in the chat, and the chat display is updated as soon as the database is updated with a new sent/received image. It was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL.

 <p><span class="projecthead">A contributor to <a href="https://github.com/security-cheatsheets/Cheatsheets" target="_blank">Security Cheatsheets</a>.</span><br> 
This project expands upon the default set of cheatsheets, and the purpose of these cheatsheets are to aid penetration testers/CTF participants/security enthusiasts in remembering commands that are useful, but not frequently used. The "sheets" themselves are written in plain text, and run using the cheatsheet setup from the main library.</p>
