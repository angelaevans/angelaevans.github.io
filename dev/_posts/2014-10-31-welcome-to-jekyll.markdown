So, I've done it guys. I have made a blog. Obviously there is a lot of tweeking and editing and changing left to be done, but it sure feels like a step in the right direction. I got Jekyll up and running on my site with the kind assistance of [@andrewuf], [@juthilo], and of course [Jekyll] themselves.

Once I am happy with the formatting of this new blog toy of mine, I'll give you an update of what is to come with the blog. See ya later!
