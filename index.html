  <p>I'm a fledgling IT careerwoman, and it makes me super excited. The more I work in this field, the more confident I become that I have found my calling. Currently I work in the IT department of Leland Management, a HOA Management comapny. Everyone is very nice, and I learn new things every day. I try to stuff as much as I can under my belt as experience in the hopes of one day getting the hell out of Florida! I have an unreasonable love of coffee and cats, and my favorite nights are spent coding with a cup of coffee and a TV show playing in the background.</p>
