  <p>I'm a fourth year Senior at the University of Florida working hard for a Computer Science Engineering degree, and aiming towards a minor in Mathematics. My primary focus is on writing code and learning as much as I can about computers because, well, it's what I love to do and know. Recently, due largely to completing an Introduction to Database Systems course, I've been most interested in learning about databases and database systems. This semester I am taking the sequel course, Information and Database Systems II. I have an unreasonable love of coffee and cats, and my favorite nights are spent coding with a cup of coffee and a TV show playing in the background.</p>
