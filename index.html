  <p>I'm a fresh graduate from the University of Florida with a shiny Computer Science Engineering degree and Mathematics minor. My primary focus is on writing code and learning as much as I can about computers because, well, it's what I love to do and know. Recently, due to my part-time student job and a few courses, I've been most interested in exploring careers related to IT systems and management as well as careers involving the management of databases/database systems. Now that I have finished all of my classes, I am applying to any company that I think may have me in the hopes of finding employment. I have an unreasonable love of coffee and cats, and my favorite nights are spent coding with a cup of coffee and a TV show playing in the background.</p>
