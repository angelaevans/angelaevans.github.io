Again, here I am avoiding studying for an exam. My room is clean, my laundry is getting done, so what is left to do that is productive but not studying for my Networking exam? Sure, I'll make a blog post. It's been a hot minute for sure.

I guess, coming back from my last post, I should mention that my partner and I turned in our Senior Project to our advisor this last Wednesday. We were quite worried that he wouldn't be satisfied with our progress; we had worked very very hard, but were unsure as to how much our result lined up with the result our advisor was expecting. The long and the short of it is that he was actually quite pleased with our work. We heard more praise in that final demo than we had collectively throughout the entirety of the semester. He scored us both very highly, only marking us down slightly in one area because it "would be suspicious if perfect score, no?"

Needless to say I am very pleased with that. The project turned out very well, and while it is far from done, my partner and I both wish to continue development after this semester. Soon Ludere.tv will be publically hosted! Just wait!
(pst, here's a sneak peak! [The home page of Ludere, partway through development]({{ site.url }}/image/devhome.png))

Other than that, it's mostly been the grind of trying to work enough hours to have food but also little enough that I have enough time to work on final assignments and study for exams. It's kept me busy enough that there isn't much news on the job front. Hopefully I have more progress there over the summer...

Guess I really should study for that exam...
