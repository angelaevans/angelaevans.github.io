description: I've been meaning to come on here and update this with a new post for a while now. I think I just needed to be in a more stable place to be able to put down what I was thinking in words that I had to place. I'm not sure I'm in a more stable place now, but I got an awesome new keyboard so it's as good a time as any. Let me tell you about my 8-5.

So much has happened since my last post. I'm not even sure where to start. I was still doing job applications in my apartment in Gainesville. I think I will do a few updates in parts. This one will be about maybe the most relavent, my job.

Well. First, I found a job. It wasn't with any known company from the tech world, and I actually found it on Craigslist after moving to Orlando right before I started applying in the food service industry. I had been applying around to IT related positions, and had been finding my lack of necessary experience really frustrating. I found one that sounded great on Craigslist, and was contacted the next day by HR. I then found out that the Director of IT for the company was a female, and I started legitimately lusting after the position. On the last day I had given myself before declaring myself desperate enough to apply to a restaurant, I got a call from that Director offering me the position.

Part of why they took me, I'm sure, is that I offered myself at a very low hourly rate under the "Get your foot in the door" policy. For the most part, it seems to have worked out. I'm part of a small internal IT team that manages "everything that plugs into an outlet" and live a varried and interesting job life. I also got a small streak of pay raises. I went from being on the low end of hourly, to a good hourly, to a great salaried position. I was feeling pretty on top of the world as I slowly tackled the bills that had piled up in the move and job hunt time. I was having a great time, and loved going into work every morning despite the hour long communte each way. I still do for the most part.

They honeymoon is a bit over, though, and I'm starting to wonder if I need to look into another position or at least update my resume. I obviously came into the field inexperienced, but I was working under a man who had been in the field for 20+ years and felt confident in my place and ability to learn what I needed to. It all started to go downhill when they fired this man for reasons unclear to me, and I haven't felt on my feet since. I had one big mistake, and I can't seem to get that feeling of confidence back. I'm going into work tomorrow, the before my birthday, with yet another failure under my belt because I was asked to deploy a piece of software by GPO to the corporate populice and I had never done so before. I don't know what went wrong, I tested it as best as I knew how and it was working. I'm not sure if it's just a lack of experience or if I'm still shaken from Paul being fired. I do know I feel a lot less stable there than I did 2 months ago. 

That in mind, I should probably actually get to bed now that I work that 8-5 life. I'll post another update soon with something more fun, like shopping for the apartment :)
