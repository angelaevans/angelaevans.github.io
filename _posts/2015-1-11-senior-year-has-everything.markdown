description: I'm starting to get busy in my final full semester of my senior year at UF, and it's more than I expected...

So, I think I'm coming to a realization. You get to college, and initially it's really different and powerful, and often stressful, but you end up getting used to it. The semesters all have a similar flow of ups and downs, and so do the years. You get comfortable without realizing it; at least, that's what happened to me.

So far though, this year is veeeery different for me. Everything just seems like more. There is more that I need to be doing, that I should be doing. There is more stress and more fun. There is more fear and more excitement. I can't just habitually go with the flow anymore, and I don't know how I feel about it.

That being said, the all important applying to jobs process has begun. I have an updated and (relatively) final resume all prepared. This website is at a level that I plan to keep it at for a while. I just need to buck up and have as much fun as I can on this ride. For now, that means coding while re-watching [Friends] on Netflix!
