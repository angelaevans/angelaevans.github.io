description: Well. I finally did the thing. Finished my last class, and waiting for my diploma to be mailed. What is left? Oh, just everything else and the rest of forever...

No more classes. No more cramming for exams. No more Gainesville soon. It really just doesn't feel real. Packing for the first time in 3 years is a lot more daunting than I thought it would be. It's really incredible how much -stuff- you can accumulate over 3 years. Slowly but surely, everything I own is getting put into box after box and taped up for their journey.

Even worse than packing, though, is the job hut. There is almost nothing that I hate more than filling out job applications. In my experience, it is as demoralizing as it is time consuming. Never the less, I am trying to put out as many as I can in the hopes that eventually someone will give me a chance. I really just want to tape a banner to my forehead saying "Hey! I work really really hard! Give me a chance, and I'll impress you!!" but sadly it doesn't work that way.

In the mean time, the Angela anime recommendation of the day goes out to [World Trigger]! It is very good and exciting, and an all around good watch. Give it a go :)

I'll get back to those job applications now..... *sigh*
