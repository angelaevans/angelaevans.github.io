First off, I'd like to mention that at my last weekly meeting with the senior project adviser that my partner and I attended, we actually impressed him enough that he told us "I am happy." I mean nothing bad by saying this, but he is a relatively intense fellow, and a brilliant programmer, so having our progress bring him to say he is pleased feels SUPER GREAT. The following is a link to a screenshot of what we ended up showing him:

Might not look like much, but it represents a lot of working pieces coming together! Feel free to email for details, or to ask about more on the senior project.

Aside from that, it's just been a lot of getting stuff done for classes and trying to find a real adult job out there. A bit of progress has been made on the future employment front, but not enough that I think it is worth sharing the details yet. Hopefully in the months to come, my current leads bear fruit and I can be less vague!

Enough studying avoidance though,
Angela out
