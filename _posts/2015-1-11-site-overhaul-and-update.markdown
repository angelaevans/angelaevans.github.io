Wow, that took a lot longer than I ever intended it to. My goodness. But yes, I now have my website up and running at a level that satisfies me. With that done, and a new semester underway, I can -hopefully- start posting more regularly.

I am currently at the very start of my last full semester at the University of Florida. I will be walking in May, leaving one 3 credit course left to take in the summer semester, and then I'm all finished. Yes. It is terrifying, exciting, too far away, too soon, and pretty much every feeling you might be able to think of. 

That being said, my original intention for this blog was to be primarily a development blog cataloging my progress on my Senior Project. Things have changed a bit since that initial idea. I have since picked up a partner that liked my idea enough to sign on to be my partner for the project, and we are in the very very early stages of developing a web service tentatively named [SeenByMe]. I still intend to use this blog to talk about the project as it progresses, but I will also use it on a more personal level to talk about my last months here at UF on occasion.

I look forward to posting more! If there is anything specific you would like to see me post about, feel free email me your suggestion!
